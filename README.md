# COP_3003_Integration_Project

**What is this project?**

This project will be a mobile app developed using Flutter, it will consist of a clicker/idle styled game meant to serve as a demonstration of the programming concepts I have learned.

**Why was this project chosen?**

The reason why I chose this project is due to an interest in mobile and game development. I like the idea of making a project I can run anywhere as long as I have my phone with me, and I would also like to do a project which I can easily share with friends and family.

**By when will this be done?**

The project will be delivered December 15th, but as detailed in the issues page there will be different sprints commited both on November 4th and November 24th.

**First Prototype**

The first prototype consists of two buttons, one with a counter for oranges and one with a counter for apples. These buttons can be pressed to increment their respective counters, while at the same time they both increment the overall "fruits" counter. This concept will eventually evolve into upgrades which will allow for more fruits to be obtained per click bought at the expense of total fruits, as well as an automic fruit farm which will earn the player a set number of fruits based on real time passage.
